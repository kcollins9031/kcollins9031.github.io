<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kimberly Collins</strong> hails from San Antonio, Texas where she attends Douglas 
MacArthur High School. She is an Officer for the Health Issues Department of the International Youth Council, a leader of 
the Burmese String Club, a Senior Member of MacTEACH, a Semifinalist in the Coca-Cola Scholars Program, a 2015 Bank of America Student Leader, and an avid member of her school’s
chapters of the National Honor Society and Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica. A proponent of Social Activism, girls in STEM, Immigration 
Reform, Music Education in public schools, and general Global Health Efforts, she spends much of her free time making strides to ensure 
her community is the best it can be by serving the underserved.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A product of asperger syndrome, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and dyslexia, Kimberly had a 
difficult childhood experience. She didn't speak until four and didn't read until six.  However, struggling in the social and
academic sphere has impassioned her to help at-risk children. Founder of her own successful 
teddy bear collection cause, she saw her vision of 
busting through the language barriers that come when ministering to those new to the country come to fruition. 
Throughout her time with the Methodist Children's Hospital and Baptist Child & Family Services (BCFS), a home for undocumented
immigrants (ages 3-18) from all over South and Central America, she has received "Build-A-Bear Workshop" grants and has single-handily
delivered stuffed animals to over 600. This allows her to foster hope and a sense of community in these sick or displaced children. 
Inspired by her 8 week internship with Communities in Schools of San Antonio (CISSA), a nonprofit that has a name in dropout prevention,
she partnered with CISSA and P&M Hoskins, LLC to collect over $6,500 
in monetary donations and school supplies for the economically disadvantaged children of San Antonio this back to school 
season. As a Senior Member of MacTEACH, she offers mentorship and academic tutoring to at-risk elementary, middle and high 
school students. And last but not least, she is a leader of the Burmese String Club, which offers free instruments 
and lessons on classical music reading and violin performance in efforts to alleviate culture shock and build confidence
in young refugees from Myanmar.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Kimberly is an active member of her high school's varsity orchestra. Playing the violin since 
11 years of age, she has found many successes as a musician, despite never having private lessons. Now named a Texas Music 
Scholar, she has many other achievements through the Texas Music Educators Association, including being a  6 time recipient of 
Sweepstakes at UIL Concert and Sight Reading Competition, 7 time recipient of superior ratings at UIL Solo/Ensemble Competition,
and 7 time All-Region Orchestra member. She was accepted into UTSA's Summer Music Institution as a chamber musician in 2014,
has lettered in orchestra and earned two bars, and most recently been voted Secretary of the MacArthur Orchestra(s) by her
peers.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">But she doesn't just identify as a philantropist or musician, she's also an eccentric intellectual.
Kimberly has been named an AP Scholar with Honor by the College Board and has taken (or is currently enrolled in) a vast 12 AP classes including Environmental Science,
Psychology, United States Government, Macroeconomics, Physics, and 2 forms of Calculus. She is a dual credit student through
the local San Antonio College where she's taken United States History, Biology, and 2 English classes. Her deep appreciation
for history is well-demonstrated by winning the cash prize for the San Antonio Civil War Round Table's 2015 writing competition with her APA,
research-style paper on "Reconstruction in Texas". She loves science and has recently began a research internship under Dr. Sunil Ahuji of the UT
Health Science Center SA. Also passionate about technology, she is a 5 time Academic State Qualifier
in the Calculator Applications subject and recently won a coding award at "SoHacks 2", a local 24-hour Hackathon, for her first ever work in Web
Development. She currently has a GPA of over 108 and is projected to graduate in June 2016 "Distinguished", Summa Cum Laude
and with highest honors.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the future, Kimberly is interested in travelling, studying Medicine, Music and/or Computer
Science as a first generation college student, and growing her teddy bear collection cause. She also hopes to come back to the roots of her altruistic
youth to start her own private practice and work with Faith City Missions, Haven for Hope, Keep Austin Beautiful, 
the Elf Louise Project, Paws Ranch Rescue & Animal Sanctuary, the Buddy Walk, and the other local nonprofits mentioned above, once more.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Kimberly draws inspiration from a quote by Rabindranath Tagore: "I slept and dreamt that life
was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy."</p>
