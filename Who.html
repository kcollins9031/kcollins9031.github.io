<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kimberly Collins</strong> hails from San Antonio, Texas where she attends Douglas MacArthur High School. She is an Officer for the Health Issues Department of the International Youth Council, a Co-Leader of the Burmese String Club, a Senior Member of MacTEACH, a 2015 Bank of America Student Leader, and an avid member of her school’s chapter of the National Honor Society and Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica. A proponent of Social Activism, History, Immigration Reform, Education, Technology, Animal Rights, Music, Down Syndrome Awareness and general Global Health Efforts, she dedicates much of her free time making strides to ensure her community is the best it can be by hosting drives through her school and place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No newcomer to fundraising, Kimberly loves helping needy kids, many of whom are new to the country. After spending 8 weeks of her summer interning at Communities in Schools of San Antonio, where she worked with grades K-5th and learned the mechanics of nonprofits through administrative and clerical work, she partnered with CISSA and P&M Hoskins, LLC to collect over $6,500 in monetary donations and school supplies for the economically disadvantaged children of San Antonio this Back to School season. Founder of her own successful teddy bear collecting cause, she saw her vision of busting through the language barriers that come when ministering to new immigrants come to fruition. Throughout her time with the Baptist Child & Family Services (BCFS), a home for young undocumented immigrants from all over South and Central America, she has received "Build-A-Bear Workshop" grants and has single-handily collected over 600 stuffed animals, fostering hope and a sense of community in these lost, and often time abused, children. As a Senior Member of MacTEACH, she volunteers before school and during her lunch period, offering mentorship and tutoring for at-risk elementary, middle and high school students. And last but not least, she is a Co-Leader of the Burmese String Club, which offers free instruments and lessons on classical music reading and violin performance in efforts to alleviate culture shock and build confidence in new immigrants from Burma, ages 3-18.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kimberly is an active member of her high school's varsity orchestra. Playing the violin since 11 years of age, she has found many successes as a musician, despite never having private lessons. Now named a Texas Music Scholar, she has many other achievements through the Texas Music Educators Association, including being a 7 time recipient of superior ratings at UIL Solo/Ensemble Competition, 7 time recipient of Sweepstakes at UIL Concert and Sight Reading Competition, and 6 time All-Region Orchestra member. She was accepted into UTSA's Summer Music Institution as a chamber musician in 2014, has lettered in orchestra and earned two bars, and most recently been voted Secretary of the MacArthur Orchestra(s) by her peers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But she doesn't just identify as a philantropist or musician, she's also an intellectual. Kimberly is an AP Scholar who has taken (or is currently enrolled in) a vast 12 AP classes including Environmental Science, Psychology, United States Government, Macroeconomics, Physics, and 2 forms of Calculus. She is a dual credit student through the local San Antonio College where she's taken United States History, Biology, and 2 English classes. Her deep appreciation for history is well-demonstrated by winning the San Antonio Civil War Round Table's writing competition with her APA, research-style paper on "Reconstruction in Texas". Also passionate about technology, she is a 5 time Academic State Qualifier in the Calculator subject and recently won a prize at "SoHacks 2", a local 24-hour Hackathon, for her first ever work in Web Development. She currently has a GPA of over 108 and is projected to graduate in June 2016 "Distinguished", Summa Cum Laude and with highest honors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the future, Kimberly is interested in travelling, studying Biology, Music and/or Computer Science in college and pursuing a career in Diagnostic Radiology someday. She also hopes to come back to the roots of her altruistic youth and work with Faith City Missions, Haven for Hope, Keep Austin Beautiful, the Elf Louise Project, Paws Ranch Rescue & Animal Sanctuary, the Buddy Walk, and the other local nonprofits mentioned above, once more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kimberly draws inspiration from a quote by Rabindranath Tagore: "I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy."</p>
